                <h1>FIRST & FOREMOST... THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Keenan Tate Normington <strong>(b. 2002)</strong>. I am a photographer currently based in
                    Milwaukee, WI. My
                    roots are in Wisconsin, which is where Iâ€™ve spent my entire life thus far.</p>

                <p>
                    I am a senior studying photography/imaging at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (Peck School of
                    the
                    Arts).

                </p>

                <p>In the realm of photography & image making, my interests span across various genres including;
                    portraiture, landscape, and studio work. I am also eager to learn more about the use of
                    alternative materials and processes. I am drawn to the use of both digital photography & analog
                    film,
                    with a special interest in black and white imagery.</p>

                <p>
                    My goal is to create an atmosphere that explores the many aspects of the human experience, while
                    also
                    illuminating the connections that exist between individuals and the world around us. Through the use
                    of
                    visual language that conveys the emotions, experiences, personalities, and overall themes of the
                    subjects within my photographs, I aim to highlight the beauty in the raw and unpolished moments of
                    life.

                </p>
                <p>
                    My work seeks to evoke a sense of shared experience in the viewer, while also capturing the beauty
                    and
                    complexity of the world we inhabit.

                </p>
